# automate-projects
To use Python and Github REST API to automate the creation of repo and directories for a new project.

## Goals
There are a few steps that I'd like to automate:
1. Creating a directory in the name of the project
2. Initialise git in that directory and make a README.md file
3. Create a Github Repo in the name of the project
4. Commit.
5. Open VS Code in that directory.

## How to use
(Will be here soon.)

## Blog
If you'd like to understand how the project was built, read my article:
(I'll add it here soon.)
